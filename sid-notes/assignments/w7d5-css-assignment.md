# Screenshots to CSS

**TODO**: Rewrite more formal!

Here are today's CSS assignments. We are working in pairs. Yay!

For each assignment, make a new separate html and css file in a folder.

It's going to be tough to get started, but you'll quickly get the hang of it.

Start analyzing the layout by thinking of everything as being contained in boxes. Then find all horizontally adjacent boxes, and draw a grouping box that wraps them. Many boxes probably will be nested several levels deep. You will use floats (and the clearfix we talked about) to align these horizontally.

Now that you have a mental model of the boxes on the page, start crafting your html document. Think about using correct semantic tags. Look at the html reference. The better your markup, the easier your styling will be.

Next move on to css. Don't forget to write a reset for the tags you used, as to avoid browser styling conflicts. Start with common tags and the most outer elements, getting the big picture right. Then focus on individual sections. Just like the coding you've done so far, experiment, try different approaches, iterate quickly, and refactor.

Any time you encounter images in the design, you may substitute them with any of your own liking, or even just a colored div as a placeholder. If you are in need of icons, go ahead and use unicode icons (like the ones you used with chess). You could also use the web inspector to copy the actual image resources, but this is not required. Some may use complicated sprites that would set you back.

Do not worry about shading, shadows, glows, texture, or even the exact shade of color. The core of today's exercises is that you get the positioning and markup right. The rest is simply icing on the cake.

Do not worry about responsiveness and interactivity. As a bonus, you may attempt to add such features once done. We will talk more in depth about those things later in the course.

Do not look at the stylesheets of the websites, but rather take a screenshot and recreate the page, using just that image.

Tip: use `cmd + shift + 4` to get the Mac screenshot tool. I use this to measure dimensions all the time. After clicking and dragging you see the little dimension numbers. Then hit escape to stop, without actually taking a screenshot.

You can also zoom your screen using `ctrl + scroll` to inspect what is really going on on a pixel level.

If you open the images or screenshots in the Preview app, you also get a crosshair which you can use to measure element dimensions. Make sure you keep the image open at 100% (actual size).
